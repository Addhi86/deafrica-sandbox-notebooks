    "\n",
    "> * When adding **Products used**, embed the hyperlink to that specific product on the DE Africa Explorer using the `[product_name](product url)` syntax.\n",
    "> * When writing in Markdown cells, start each sentence on a **new line**.\n",
    "This makes it easy to see changes through git commits.\n",
    "> * To faciliate the easy conversion of these notebooks into a docs help page, check the [known issues](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-docs/wiki/Known-issues) for formatting regarding the conversion of notebooks to DE Africa docs using Sphinx.\n",
    "Things to be aware of:\n",
    "    * Sphinx is highly sensitive to bulleted lists:\n",
    "        * Ensure that there is an empty line between any preceding text and the list\n",
    "        * Only use the `*` bullet (`-` is not recognised)\n",
    "        * Sublists must be indented by 4 spaces\n",
    "    * Two kinds of formatting cannot be used simultaneously:\n",
    "        * Hyperlinked code: \\[\\`code_format\\`](hyperlink) fails\n",
    "        * Bolded code: \\*\\*\\`code_format\\`\\*\\* fails\n",
    "    * Headers must appear in hierachical order (`#`, `##`, `###`, `####`) and there can only be one title (`#`).\n",
    "> * Use the [PEP8 standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for code. To make sure all code in the notebook is consistent, you can use the `jupyterlab_code_formatter` tool: select each code cell, then click `Edit` and then one of the `Apply X Formatter` options (`YAPF` or `Black` are recommended). This will reformat the code in the cell to a consistent style.\n",
    "> * In the final notebook cell, include a set of relevant **keywords** which are used to build the DE Africa User Guide's [keyword Index](https://digital-earth-africa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/genindex.html).\n",
    "    * Use the list of approved documentation keywords on the [wiki page](https://github.com/digitalearthafrica/deafrica-sandbox-notebooks/wiki/List-of-Documentation-Keywords).\n",
    "    * Avoid using keywords that link to specific modules in `deafrica_tools`.\n",
    "    * Use all lower-case (unless the tag is an acronym), separate words with spaces\n",
    "    * Ensure the keywords cell below is in `Raw` format, rather than `Markdown` or `Code`.\n"

    "This notebook is an outcome of the ODC 2021 women sprint. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral-temporal features from time-series Earth observation data are often used to distinguish land cover types and monitor their evolution over time. They are particularly useful for understanding dynamic ecosystems such as wetlands.\n",

    "Many methods have been developed to derive spectral and temporal features from optical or radar remote sensing data. Their effectiveness vary for different environments.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Sentinel-1](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1) mission is composed of a constellation of two Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites, Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B, sharing the same orbital plane. Sentinel-1 provides dual polarisation capability, very short revisit times, and rapid product delivery. The mission currently collects data every 12 days over Africa at a spatial resolution of approximately 20m. Sentinel-1A was launched on 3 April 2014 and Sentinel-1B followed on 25 April 2016. Two other spacecraft (Sentinel-1C and Sentinel-1D) are planned to replace the first two satellites at the end of their operational lifespan. For more information on the Sentinel-1 platforms and applications, check out the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-1) website.\n",
    "\n",
    "SAR data has the advantage of operating at wavelengths not impeded by cloud cover and can acquire data over a site during the day or night. The Sentinel-1 mission is the European Radar Observatory for the Copernicus joint initiative of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA) that can offer reliable and repeated wide area monitoring with its SAR instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Radar backscatter measures the amount of microwave radiation reflected back to the centre from the ground surface. This measurement is sensitive to surface roughness, moisture content, and viewing geometry. DEAfrica provides Sentinel-1 backscatter as Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) gamma-0 (Î³0) where variation due to changing observation geometries has been mitigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "DE Africa provides Sentinel-1 data acquired in Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode and with dual polarisation (VV and VH). The dual polarisation backscatter timeseries can be used in applications for forests, agriculture, wetlands, and land cover classification. SAR's ability to see through clouds makes it critical for mapping and monitoring land cover changes in the wet tropics. \n",
    "\n",
    "DEAfrica Sentinel-1 backscatter is processed to be compliant with the [CEOS Analysis Ready Data for Land (CARD4L)](https://ceos.org/ard/) specification. More technical information can be found in the [DE Africa User Guide](https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/Sentinel-1_specs.html).\n"
